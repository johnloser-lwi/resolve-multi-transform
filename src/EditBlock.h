/** @brief RAII wrapper around OFX's parameter edit block.
 *
 * The OFX spec is explicit that when a plugin calls paramSetValue itself --
 * "either from custom GUI interaction or some analysis of imagery" -- the
 * writes must be bracketed by paramEditBegin/paramEditEnd, from inside an
 * interact action or kOfxActionInstanceChanged.
 *
 * Every parameter this plugin writes is exactly that case: the viewer overlay's
 * gizmo, timeline and curve handles, the Set Start/End buttons, the easing
 * presets, and the derived Duration read-out. Without the brackets a host has
 * been told nothing about the edit. Resolve tolerates it. Fusion does not: it
 * kept serving cached frames after any overlay drag or button press, while
 * edits made through its own Inspector -- which the host performs itself, and
 * therefore already knows about -- updated correctly. That asymmetry is the
 * signature of this bug.
 *
 * Bracketing also groups a drag into a single undo step instead of one per
 * mouse-move event, which is the behaviour the block was designed for.
 */

/** @brief Open an edit block, or note that one is already open.
 *
 * Reference counted, and that is the whole point.
 *
 * These blocks nest in practice and there is no way to avoid it: the overlay
 * opens one for a drag, the widget it hands the drag to opens its own, and
 * every paramSetValue inside that is dispatched by the host straight back into
 * changedParam, where handlers like markEasingCustom open a third. Clicking one
 * curve in the library goes three deep.
 *
 * OFX does not say what nesting means, and a host that treats
 * paramEditBegin/End as a flag rather than a counter breaks on it: the
 * innermost end closes the outer block, and the two ends that follow are
 * unmatched. That leaves the host's parameter and interact state inconsistent
 * for the rest of the session -- which is exactly the shape of a bug where the
 * viewer's on-screen controls stop responding, in this plugin and in everything
 * else, until Resolve is restarted.
 *
 * Counting here means the host only ever sees one begin and one matching end,
 * however deeply the plugin nests.
